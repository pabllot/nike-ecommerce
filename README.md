On this fake nike ecommerce I implemented:
Advanced React Best Practices such as folder and file structure, hooks, and refs.
Advanced State Management of the entire application using React Context API.
Next.js Best Practices such as file-based routing and data using server-side rendering and static generation
Integratation of Stripe to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process.
Usage of Sanity,a unified content platform that made the entire app possible
